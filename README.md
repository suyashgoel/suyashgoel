# Hi, I'm Suyash Goel 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at UC Davis passionate about **AI**, **software engineering**, and building **startup-ready solutions**. Here's a glimpse into my world:

## 🧠 Current Focus

I'm leading the development of an **Explainable AI (XAI) platform** for researchers, making complex vision models more interpretable. I'm also researching advanced deep learning techniques in ophthalmology, developing object detection models to track cell division patterns and cell segmentation models using syntetic datasets.

## 🔭 Technical Journey

I thrive at the intersection of **AI research** and **practical application**:

- 🤖 Training custom object detection models and cell segmentation models for detecting subtle biological occurrences
- 🎯 Implementing Vision Transformers for medical image analysis with SOTA XAI techniques
- 🛠️ Building full-stack applications with **Next.js**, **Flutter**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL**
- 👥 Leading technical teams through complex development cycles with Agile methodologies

## 👨‍💻 What I'm Building

- An **XAI platform** that helps researchers interpret image classifier outputs
- **Deep learning pipelines** for ophthalmological data analysis
- **Educational tools** for developers in the UC Davis tech community

## 🌱 Learning & Growing

I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in:
- Advanced deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GANs, Diffusion Models)
- Startup ecosystems and venture capital dynamics
- Building products that solve real problems people will pay for

## 🏆 Projects

- **SkinScreen**: An AI-powered skin cancer detection tool recognized at HackDavis
- **Explainable Vision Transformers**: Enhancing interpretability of AI in medical imaging
- **Password Manager App**: A full-stack solution with Flutter and MERN stack

## 💬 Beyond Tech

When I'm not coding or researching:
- 🎧 Listening to podcasts (Morning Brew Daily is a favorite!)
- 🐕 Spending time with my dog, friends, and family
- 💪 Working out and staying active
- 🗣️ Engaging in discussions about politics and current events
- ✈️ Traveling and exploring new places
